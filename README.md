# COMP472 Mini Project 2
This project implements and analyzes the different state search algorithms for the game Rush Hour. The board is represented in a 6x6 2-D numpy array where "A A" represents the ambulance and "." represents an empty cell.

The goal of the game is for the ambulance to reach the exit which is at the position [2, 5] of the board. Each vehicle has a fuel of 100 unless stated; therefore, when a vehicle reaches zero, it cannot be moved anymore. 

The state space search algorithms that are implemented in this project are Uniform Cost Search (UCS), Greedy Best First Search (GBFS), and A/A*.
